## Developer Notes for Advisor FE

### Development Environment Setup

#### Required Tools

- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub Desktop

#### Setup Instructions

Install the above tools, accept all defaults. Create a GitHub account with your UW-Stout email address.

_Server Setup_

- Clone this repository
- Open the cloned folder in Visual Studio Code (vscode): File > Open Folder the cloned folder
- Use `npm` to install all dependent Node.js modules:
  - Open a Terminal: Terminal > New Terminal
  - Type `npm install`
- Install the following vscode extensions:
  eslint, prettier, prettier eslint, markdown all in one

- Make the following vscode setting changes:

  - Editor: Format on Save - turn on
  - Editor: Default Formatter - Prettier - Code Formatter (esbenp.prettier-vscode)
  - Eslint â€º Code Actions On Save: Mode - set to problems

- In the cloned folder, create a .env file, and populate with local variables:

  ```env
  PORT=3000
  PG_CONNECTION_STRING=postgres://postgres:<masterpassword>@localhost:5432/<dbname>
  STYTCH_PROJECT_ID=<See Canvas Notes>
  STYTCH_SECRET=<See Canvas Notes>
  MASTER_ADMIN_EMAIL=<your UW-Stout Email>
  ```

**To run the API server**, from a terminal: run `npm start`

**To run the API server with nodemon**, from a terminal: run `npm run dev`, this will monitor for changes to codebase and will restart the server automatically if it detects a change, pretty nice for active development and testing.

**To run the API server in debug**, with vcode: Run > Start Debugging, Select Node.js if prompted

**To run all Jest tests**, from a terminal: run `npm test`

**To run all Jest tests in debug**, from a terminal: run `npm run test:debug`

### Development Conventions

- Modules are either:
  - Interface, module.exports is an object, i.e. Services, Models
  - Instance, module.exports is a function returning in an instance, Apps and Routes
- camelCase naming convention shall be used for all naming. This includes Model columns, JSON fields, and Database table columns. Note that the Stytch API uses a snake_case convention.

### Definition of Done

- Models require unit testing all non-trivial functions
- Controllers require unit testing mocking all APIs
- Serializers doing non-trivial transforms should be unit tested
- Routes should be jest tested mocking controllers and services as needed (i.e. isUserLoaded)
- Source code is fully linted with no warnings
- All jest tests run successfully
- Pull request to staging branch
- Staging branch sucessfully deployed to staging environment
- Integration tests run successfully on staging environment
